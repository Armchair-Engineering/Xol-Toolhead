### Xol Carriage
A new carriage built to allow Xol to standardise around the Voron CW2 (TAP) mounting pattern.
This is in very early stages of development. Parts are subject to change at any time.
Testing and feedback are welcome at the Xol-Toolhead channel on the Armchair Engineering discord. <https://discord.com/channels/1029426383614648421/1046422202460930129>

#### Carriage Design Goals
* Uses same mounting pattern as TAP (reduce Xol permutations)
* Easily remove toolhead from carriage without toolhead disassembly
* Modular approach to probes

#### Additional Hardware
To accommodate design requirements, some additional hardware will be required when using this mount.
Specifically:
* M2.5 heatsets are used in the feet of the Xol hotend mount
* M3 x 25mm pins (30mm for 9mm belt version) are used in the belt attachment system

The dimensions of the M2.5 heatsets are
* thread: M2.5
* Length: 4mm
* Outer Diameter: 3.5mm
(M2.5x4x3.5)

Thanks to the Armchair Engineering team and Voron Design. This carriage is built for Xol but is based heavily on the Voron Design CW2 mounting system.
