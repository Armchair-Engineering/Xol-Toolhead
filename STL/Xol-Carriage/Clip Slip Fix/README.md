# Beta fix for Xol-Carriage belt-slip issue
There have been some reports of belts slipping from the belt clip on Xol-Carriage.
The reported issues were from people using standard (not EPDM high temp) belts. 

The fix for this requires ALL carriage parts to be reprinted. Room has been made in the carriage front and rear parts to allow for a larger belt clip with longer clamping zone.

There are now two versions of the belt clip.
* 'S' versions are for standard gates GT2 belts
* 'E' versions are for EPDM high temperature gates GT2 belts

STLs in this folder have been created to address this issue and are currently being tested before replacing existing xol-carriage STLs.
