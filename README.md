# BETA EXPERIMENTAL
# Xol Toolhead
A soft reboot of Xol 2 (<https://github.com/Armchair-Engineering/Mantis-Xol>) aimed at modularity and quality of life improvements for installation and serviceability. Don't worry, it's still ugly, we couldn't fix that.

## What's new
* Standardised hotend mounts around the Voron Design CW2/TAP carriage bolt hole pattern.
  * This approach reduces the number of hotend mounts and ducts by half - You don't have to search for TAP or non-TAP and we don't have to maintain twice as many parts
* Xol-Carriage
  * A new carriage built for Xol-Toolhead
  * Uses metal pins and a belt clip to secure the belts instead of squashed between mgn9/12 carriage and toolhead carriage
  * Improved serviceability - remove the toolhead from the carriage without disassembly in the printer. Unless you use Voron TAP or refuse to buy M2.5 hardware for Xol Carriage. Buy the m2.5 hardware, it's worth it trust us.
  * Modular probe mounting system - change probes without changing the whole carriage _*Except for KlickyNG_
