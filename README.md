## What's new
* Standardised hotend mounts around the Voron Design CW2/TAP carriage bolt hole pattern.
  * This approach reduces the number of hotend mounts and ducts by half - No more searching for TAP or non-TAP parts
* Xol-Carriage
  * A new carriage built for Xol-Toolhead
  * Metal pins and clamp/clip used to secure belts instead of squashed between mgn9/12 carriage and toolhead carriage
  * Improved serviceability - remove the toolhead from the carriage without disassembly in the printer
  * Modular probe mounting system - change probes without changing the whole carriage _*Except for KlickyNG_
